--- Spirit Music ---

This mod aims to improve your Terraria experience by adding music to places that don't have it - weathers, events, vanilla biomes and more.
Currently, this mod has 16 tracks sprinkled all over the world.

You can turn off each individual track in the config too, if you only want a selection of the tracks.
This mod also supports Music Display.
